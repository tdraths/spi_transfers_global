This is a second attempt at modeling soccer team strength, after my first attempt as a student in the [Springboard Data Science track](https://www.springboard.com/).

### Modeling Soccer Team Strength, Version II
In my first attempt modeling soccer team strength, I limited my data to Premier League teams over the last five season. It was my first project, and I was nervous about getting the code exactly right. It took me ages; there was (and still is, a bit) a good deal of imposter syndrome at play - I didn't want to think of myself as a data scientist, because I just wasn't good enough. I'm still not using that description for myself - I'm a data **something**, but I know I'm still new.

For version II of this project, I committed to going back to my original work and expanding my horizons. I did the following things:
 - I used a larger data set, encompassing nine professional leagues from across Europe going over five seasons. This increased my final dataset from 100 rows to over 700 rows.
 - While I explored many of the same algorithms I used in the first version, I used [Yellowbrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/) to get a better understanding of what the algorithms were showing.
